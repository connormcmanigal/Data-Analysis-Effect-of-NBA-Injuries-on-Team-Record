# Effect-of-NBA-Injuries-on-Team-Record

This notebook is a group project from my Data Science in Practice (COGS108) class from UC San Diego. Within the notebook we conducted descriptive, exploratory, and inferential analysis on two data sets that we downloaded from Kaggle. Our code is written in python and we utilized many libraries such as: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, sklearn, and seaborn. Since this was my first 'data science project', I am excited to continue my data science journey and find more interesting topics to cover.
