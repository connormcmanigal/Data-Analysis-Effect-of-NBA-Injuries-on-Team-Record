# Effect of NBA Injuries on Team Record

This notebook is a group project from my Data Science in Practice (COGS108) class from UC San Diego. You can access the project and its contents by clicking "COGS108FinalProject.ipynb". Within the notebook we conducted descriptive, exploratory, and inferential analysis on two data sets that we downloaded from Kaggle. Our code is written in python and we utilized many libraries such as: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, sklearn, and seaborn.
